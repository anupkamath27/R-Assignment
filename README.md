Hi, Thanks for visiting my repository. This repository was created to fullfill the deliverables  for Applied analytics in business and society course at the University of Galway, Irelad.
This contains the datasets used for analysis, R studios files, quarto files and images generated and used for completing this asignment.
This rpository gives you an idea of using Rstudios, Mermaid, markdown,yam code,Knitr,quarto etc.
In Rstudios- interactive graphs, quantitative analysis like GLM,GAM, use of leaflet, adding latitude and longitudes etc are performed.
In mermaid the data flow charts are made.
In quarto, yam, markdown some features like adding images, table of content, bibligraphy etc has been experimented.
A short descriptive video has been added which briefly explains the content of the project.

Hope you would like it. Have a nice day.
